At the beginning of every week,

you can look forward to a video like this one,

from me or one of my colleagues.

We'll give you a brief rundown of

what you can expect to learn that week.

This week we'll explore how this program works.

Then, we'll cover the definition of UX design and

why UX design is important for consumers and businesses.

We'll also discuss the different roles

within the field of UX,

what makes a user experience good or poor,

the responsibilities of entry-level UX designers,

how UX designers work with cross-functional teams,

differences in UX design jobs

depending on company size and industry,

and how to pursue a career in UX design.
